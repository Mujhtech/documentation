## Introduction

Webhooks are a way for Swervpay to provide real-time data to your application. They are HTTP callbacks that receive notification messages for events. When an event occurs, Swervpay sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook's configured URL. Your endpoint should respond with a ``2xx`` status code to indicate that the event has been successfully received.

## Creating a Webhook

You can create a webhook from the [dashboard](https://app.swervpay.co/-/developers/webhooks).

## Authentication

All webhook requests include a ``SWERVPAY-SECRET`` header for verification. It should match the secret generated when creating the webhook.


## Retry

If a webhook fails, you have two main options to retry the failed delivery:

- Retry from developer section of the [dashboard](https://app.swervpay.co/-/developers/webhooks)

- Using [webhook Retry API](/api-reference/webhook/retry)
